        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <P>Joshua enjoys playing cards, performing magic, and is a billiards (known as a pool table game) addict.</P>
	    <p>Joshua had always slept late at Gerald's House, playing cards and challenging many individuals with magic. This is where his greatest joy lies.</p>
        <p>He is currently interested in pool tables.
He can't explain its addictive properties, but he can tell you why he likes it. He enjoys pool because you can never be too old to play. Many sports cause joint problems and slow response times... SOMETHING happens tocut your playing days short. After all, what other sport allows you to drink while playing?</p>
